# GraphWord

## Overview

GraphWord is a tool designed to create word-based graphs, where each node represents a word, and edges connect words that differ by a single letter. This structure facilitates various applications in natural language processing and linguistic analysis, such as exploring word relationships and transformations.

## Features

- **Graph Construction**: Generates graphs with words as nodes and edges between words differing by one letter.
- **API Integration**: Provides an API for querying and analyzing the word graphs.
- **Applications**: Useful in natural language processing tasks and linguistic studies.

## Installation

To set up the GraphWord project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JesusMatosTorres/GraphWord.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd GraphWord
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/) installed. Then, build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can utilize GraphWord to generate and analyze word graphs. Here's how to get started:

1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd target
   java -jar untitled-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
2. **Access the API**:
   Once the application is running, access the API endpoints to interact with the word graphs.
